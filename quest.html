	<h1>Dualmo Hosts Zoom Meeting (Final Project)</h1>
<p>In my final project I wanted to show Dualmo attempt to host a Zoom meeting with the fellow gods of Olympus. 
The inspiration for my project came from my experiences of my first semester online on Zoom and is meant to be a bit humorous and comment on the disconnection involved with technology and the disruption to everyday life. Itâ€™s also meant to show that very capable people in the real world may not be as capable with technology and can sometimes be humorous and frustrating at the same time. I also wanted to comment on how our private lives and public lives are interwoven and can be difficult to manage with new technology. 

I made this my own because I really used a lot of my own experiences on zoom as inspiration, I wanted it to be a bit slap stick and back and forth between Zeus and Dualmo and point light on the small problems they have with technology because we are all having to learn new ways of continuing everyday life. 

I chose to make it a stop animation and use green screen and a lot of photoshop elements to customize the zoom meeting environment, I also had to use premiere to edit a lot of the footage to make sure the comedic timing was correct. I took the photos with my camera for Dualmo behind a green background then I green screen him in adobe after effects then uploaded the video in premiere to edit the footage along with the audio that I recorded and images from photoshop I made to give the viewer the complete simulated experience.

I stayed loyal to my storyboard almost to a fault. This project took me some time to figure out and do layer by layer clip by clip and was a lot of photoshop but was worth it in the end.
